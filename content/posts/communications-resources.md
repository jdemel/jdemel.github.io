Nowadays, there are quite a few resources to learn about communications engineering. While books and papers are still used for publishing, more interactive resources are obviously really helpful. Thus, I'd like to compile a list of resources I consider to be interesting. It should be obvious that people prefer different resources. I include links to online resources where they are available.

## PySDR
The [PySDR](https://pysdr.org/) book, or website, by Marc Lichtman is a really helpful intro to many basic concepts. It includes Python/NumPy code examples o get a better understanding of how to go from theory to simulation.

## DSP Illustrations

The website [DSP Illustrations](https://dspillustrations.com/pages/index.html) by Maximilian Matthe is a great place to find explanations for specific communications topics. It is very interactive with embedded Jupyter notebooks. I really enjoyed ["How does Quantization Noise sound?"](https://dspillustrations.com/pages/posts/misc/how-does-quantization-noise-sound.html).

## Digital Signal Processing

The Jupyter notebook lecture [Digital Signal Processing](https://nbviewer.org/github/spatialaudio/digital-signal-processing-lecture/blob/master/index.ipynb) by Spors is another great interactive resource. As the title implies this lecture is on DSP, however, with emphasis on communications DSP.

## Modern Coding Theory

Coding theory is quite a difficult topic because it includes a lot of probability theory. Still, ["Modern Coding Theory" by Richardson and Urbanke]( https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511791338) does a great job at explaining these concepts.

## Essential Coding Theory

This book by Venkatesan Guruswami, Atri Rudra and Madhu Sudan is a work in progress.
The [book's overview website](https://cse.buffalo.edu/faculty/atri/courses/coding-theory/book/) contains some information on the process.
Besides [Essential Coding Theory](https://cse.buffalo.edu/faculty/atri/courses/coding-theory/book/web-coding-book.pdf) seems to be written with some humor.
I really enjoyed the chapter title "Information Theory Strikes Back: Polar Codes".
Finally, the book is released under [CC-BY-NC-ND 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/).

## Digital Communications

One of the standard books is "Digital Communications" by Proakis and Salehi. The authors write in a way that is pleasant to read. There's quite a bit of information on convolutional codes. It seems like there is still no PDF version available. I consider this a major drawback nowadays.

- Proakis & Salehi: "Digital Communications 5th Edition", 2008, McGraw-Hill, Boston, USA, ISBN: 0071263780, 9780071263788

## Wireless Communications: Principles and Practice

There's a book by Rappaport that includes an extensive section on channel models and simulations. Mostly, it includes a practical model on time-variant channels. This is an interesting approximation for Jakes spectrum.

## Nachrichtenübertragung

The book [Nachrichtenübertragung](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-322-94062-9) by Kammeyer is only available in German. I'd argue it is the default educational resource for communication engineers looking for a German book. Also, Kammeyer is the former head of [ANT](https://www.ant.uni-bremen.de/en/home/) where I currently work. Unfortunately, the latest edition [Nachrichtenübertragung 6. Auflage](https://link.springer.com/book/9783658170042) is not available online.
