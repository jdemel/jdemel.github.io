Here we go. I try to start my own website to write about things that are on my mind. Maybe this website will just hold links to all the work I did, e.g. publications.


Since I got some experience with static site generators, I decided to give [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) a try. Also, github.io pages need to be static. The [GNU Radio website](https://gnuradio.org) uses Hugo and I enjoy using it. Especially its local preview features are convincing.

If you get used to GitHub Actions, you quite enjoy them. They're simple to set up and automate things. I assume most people use them to run tests for every Pull Request and Push to a git repository. [Hugo docs to deploy to github.io](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/) look quite convenient to use CD for once.
