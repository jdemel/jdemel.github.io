# Presentations

This is a compilation of recorded presentations I've given.

## GRCon '22 Ultra reliable low latency OTA comms in GR for automated guided vehicles

At GRCon '22 [GRCon '22](https://events.gnuradio.org/event/18/) I presented: [An ultra reliable low latency over-the-air communication system in GNU Radio for automated guided vehicles](https://events.gnuradio.org/event/18/contributions/236/). This is an over-the-air demonstrator implemented in GNU Radio.
