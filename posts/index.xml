&lt;h2 id="why-do-we-keep-needing-new-gs">Why Do We Keep Needing New &amp;ldquo;G&amp;quot;s?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>SciShow has a nice intro to communications. It covers a bit of history and gives more of a 30,000 meters view.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="pysdr">PySDR&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://pysdr.org/">PySDR&lt;/a> book, or website, by Marc Lichtman is a really helpful intro to many basic concepts. It includes Python/NumPy code examples o get a better understanding of how to go from theory to simulation.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="dsp-illustrations">DSP Illustrations&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The website &lt;a href="https://dspillustrations.com/pages/index.html">DSP Illustrations&lt;/a> by Maximilian Matthe is a great place to find explanations for specific communications topics. It is very interactive with embedded Jupyter notebooks. I really enjoyed &lt;a href="https://dspillustrations.com/pages/posts/misc/how-does-quantization-noise-sound.html">&amp;ldquo;How does Quantization Noise sound?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="digital-signal-processing">Digital Signal Processing&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The Jupyter notebook lecture &lt;a href="https://nbviewer.org/github/spatialaudio/digital-signal-processing-lecture/blob/master/index.ipynb">Digital Signal Processing&lt;/a> by Spors is another great interactive resource. As the title implies this lecture is on DSP, however, with emphasis on communications DSP.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="modern-coding-theory">Modern Coding Theory&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Coding theory is quite a difficult topic because it includes a lot of probability theory. Still, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511791338">&amp;ldquo;Modern Coding Theory&amp;rdquo; by Richardson and Urbanke&lt;/a> does a great job at explaining these concepts.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="essential-coding-theory">Essential Coding Theory&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This book by Venkatesan Guruswami, Atri Rudra and Madhu Sudan is a work in progress.
The &lt;a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/faculty/atri/courses/coding-theory/book/">book&amp;rsquo;s overview website&lt;/a> contains some information on the process.
Besides &lt;a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/faculty/atri/courses/coding-theory/book/web-coding-book.pdf">Essential Coding Theory&lt;/a> seems to be written with some humor.
I really enjoyed the chapter title &amp;ldquo;Information Theory Strikes Back: Polar Codes&amp;rdquo;.
Finally, the book is released under &lt;a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/">CC-BY-NC-ND 3.0&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="digital-communications">Digital Communications&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>One of the standard books is &amp;ldquo;Digital Communications&amp;rdquo; by Proakis and Salehi. The authors write in a way that is pleasant to read. There&amp;rsquo;s quite a bit of information on convolutional codes. It seems like there is still no PDF version available. I consider this a major drawback nowadays.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Proakis &amp;amp; Salehi: &amp;ldquo;Digital Communications 5th Edition&amp;rdquo;, 2008, McGraw-Hill, Boston, USA, ISBN: 0071263780, 9780071263788&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="wireless-communications-principles-and-practice">Wireless Communications: Principles and Practice&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s a book by Rappaport that includes an extensive section on channel models and simulations. Mostly, it includes a practical model on time-variant channels. This is an interesting approximation for Jakes spectrum.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Rappaport: &amp;ldquo;Wireless communications: principles and practice 2nd Edition&amp;rdquo;, 2009, Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ, USA, ISBN: 0130422320, 9780130422323&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="nachrichtenubertragung">Nachrichtenübertragung&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The book &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-322-94062-9">Nachrichtenübertragung&lt;/a> by Kammeyer is only available in German. I&amp;rsquo;d argue it is the default educational resource for communication engineers looking for a German book. Also, Kammeyer is the former head of &lt;a href="https://www.ant.uni-bremen.de/en/home/">ANT&lt;/a> where I currently work. Unfortunately, the latest edition &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/book/9783658170042">Nachrichtenübertragung 6. Auflage&lt;/a> is not available online.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Does a github.io page work for me?</title><link>https://jdemel.github.io/posts/starting_this_website/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Feb 2022 14:27:59 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://jdemel.github.io/posts/starting_this_website/</guid><description>Here we go.

&lt;p>Since I got some experience with static site generators, I decided to give &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo&lt;/a> a try. Also, github.io pages need to be static. The &lt;a href="https://gnuradio.org">GNU Radio website&lt;/a> uses Hugo and I enjoy using it. Especially its local preview features are convincing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you get used to GitHub Actions, you quite enjoy them. They&amp;rsquo;re simple to set up and automate things. I assume most people use them to run tests for every Pull Request and Push to a git repository. &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/">Hugo docs to deploy to github.io&lt;/a> look quite convenient to use CD for once.&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>
