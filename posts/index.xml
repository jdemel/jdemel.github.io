&lt;p>Since I got some experience with static site generators, I decided to give &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo&lt;/a> a try. Also, github.io pages need to be static. The &lt;a href="https://gnuradio.org">GNU Radio website&lt;/a> uses Hugo and I enjoy using it. Especially its local preview features are convincing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you get used to GitHub Actions, you quite enjoy them. They&amp;rsquo;re simple to set up and automate things. I assume most people use them to run tests for every Pull Request and Push to a git repository. &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/">Hugo docs to deploy to github.io&lt;/a> look quite convenient to use CD for once.&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>
